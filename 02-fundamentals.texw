\chapter{Fundamentals}

This is another chapter.

Again, we can include both a command and its result:
<<test>>=
print("Stefan", len("Stefan"))
@

We define a new function:
<<hello, complete=False>>=
def hello():
    print("foo")
@
and a second line of the same function:
<<hello, complete=False>>=
    print("bar")
@
So, what does \texttt{hello()} do?
<<test>>=
hello()
@
