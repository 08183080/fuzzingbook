Such generated tests can be extended into ordinary tests, by adding code that checks for correct behavior; or be used for \"fuzzing\", that is, finding inputs that cause a program to crash, hang, or otherwise malfunction.  The aim is to exercise a maximum of functionality with a minimum of effort."

    "Software test generation brings software quality to a new level.  Not only are we talking about automatically _executing_ software tests (as with unit testing), but actually _producing_ software tests automatically.  In contrast to the simple generation of random inputs (or \"fuzzing\"), we discuss test generation techniques that adhere to the input language, that systematically cover code structure, and that even are able to automatically learn the input language of the program under test.  These novel techniques lead to dramatic improvements in test generation and software testing, and they now are mature enough to be assembled in a book - even with executable code."
