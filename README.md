# Generating Software Tests

This is the repository for the book "Generating Software Tests" (working title)

To start reading right away, start with the [main notebook](notebooks/Main.ipynb).


## Contents

This book is to become a _textbook on software test generation,_ teaching students and professionals alike the latest and greatest concepts in test generation and fuzzing.  The book would come with plenty of code samples that allow the reader to immediately try out the concepts as well as extend them for her/his own purposes.  The individual chapters come in Jupyter notebook format, to allow for easy interaction with the code, conversion to other formats, and extensions.


## Organization

The contents of this book will include topics such as:

* Preface
1. Introduction to Testing
2. Text-Based Fuzzing
3. Mutation-Based Fuzzing
4. Fuzzing and Debugging
5. Grammar-Based Fuzzing
6. Fuzzing Function Calls
7. Fuzzing User Interfaces
8. Parsing and Mutating Inputs
9. Search-Based Testing
10. Constraint-Based Testing
11. Mining Grammars
12. Fuzzing and Mutations
13. Probabilistic Testing
14. Carving Unit Tests
15. Fuzzing and Invariants
16. Protection and Repair
* Glossary

Each chapter would be about 10â€“20 pages in length, including code. Each chapter comes with exercises, typically extending the given code in some way, as well as references to related work.
