# # _Title_
# 
# _Brief abstract/introduction/motivation.  State what the chapter is about in 1-2 paragraphs._

# **Prerequisites**
# 
# * _Refer to earlier chapters as notebooks here, as here:_ [Earlier Chapter](Basic_Fuzzing.ipynb).

# 
# _If you want to introduce code, it is helpful to state the most important functions, as in:_
# 
# * `random.randrange(start, end)` - return a random number [`start`, `end`]
# * `range(start, end)` - create a list with integers from `start` to `end`.  Typically used in iterations.
# * `for elem in list: body` executes `body` in a loop with `elem` taking each value from `list`.
# * `for i in range(start, end): body` executes `body` in a loop with `i` from `start` to `end` - 1.
# * `chr(n)` - return a character with ASCII code `n`

# ## Lessons Learned
# 
# * _Lesson one_
# * _Lesson two_
# * _Lesson three_

# ## Next Steps
# 
# _Link to subsequent chapters (notebooks) here, as in:_
# 
# * [use _mutations_ on existing inputs to get more valid inputs](Mutation_Fuzzing.ipynb)
# * [use _grammars_ (i.e., a specification of the input format) to get even more valid inputs](Grammars.ipynb)
# * [reduce _failing inputs_ for efficient debugging](Reducing.ipynb)
# 

# ## Exercises
# 
# Close the chapter with a few exercises such that people have things to do.  In Jupyter Notebook, use the `exercise2` nbextension to add solutions that can be interactively viewed or hidden:
# 
# * Mark the _last_ cell of the exercise (this should be a _text_ cell) as well as _all_ cells of the solution.  (Use the `rubberband` nbextension and use Shift+Drag to mark multiple cells.)
# * Click on the `solution` button at the top.
# 
# (Alternatively, just copy the exercise and solution cells below with their metadata.)

# ### Exercise 1
# 
# _Text of the exercise_

# In[1]:


# Some code that is part of the exercise


# _Some more text for the exercise_

# _Some text for the solution_

# In[2]:


# Some code for the solution
2 + 2


# _Some more text for the solution_

# ### Exercise 2
# 
# _Text of the exercise_

# _Solution for the exercise_
