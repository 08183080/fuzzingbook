# # _Title_
# 
# _Brief abstract/introduction/motivation.  State what the chapter is about in 1-2 paragraphs._

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print('# _Title_')




# **Prerequisites**
# 
# * _Refer to earlier chapters as notebooks here, as here:_ [Earlier Chapter](Fuzzer.ipynb).

# ## _Section 1_
# 
# \todo{Add}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print('\n## _Section 1_')




# ## _Section 2_
# 
# \todo{Add}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print('\n## _Section 2_')




# ## _Section 3_
# 
# \todo{Add}
# 
# _If you want to introduce code, it is helpful to state the most important functions, as in:_
# 
# * `random.randrange(start, end)` - return a random number [`start`, `end`]
# * `range(start, end)` - create a list with integers from `start` to `end`.  Typically used in iterations.
# * `for elem in list: body` executes `body` in a loop with `elem` taking each value from `list`.
# * `for i in range(start, end): body` executes `body` in a loop with `i` from `start` to `end` - 1.
# * `chr(n)` - return a character with ASCII code `n`

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print('\n## _Section 3_')




# import fuzzingbook_utils

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # More code
    pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Even more code
    pass


# ## _Section 4_
# 
# \todo{Add}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print('\n## _Section 4_')




# ## Lessons Learned
# 
# * _Lesson one_
# * _Lesson two_
# * _Lesson three_

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print('\n## Lessons Learned')




# ## Next Steps
# 
# _Link to subsequent chapters (notebooks) here, as in:_
# 
# * [use _mutations_ on existing inputs to get more valid inputs](MutationFuzzer.ipynb)
# * [use _grammars_ (i.e., a specification of the input format) to get even more valid inputs](Grammars.ipynb)
# * [reduce _failing inputs_ for efficient debugging](Reducing.ipynb)
#

# ## Exercises
# 
# Close the chapter with a few exercises such that people have things to do.  To make the solutions hidden (to be revealed by the user), have them start with
# 
# ```markdown
# **Solution.**
# ```
# 
# Your solution can then extend up to the next title (i.e., any markdown cell starting with `#`).
# 
# Running `make metadata` will automatically add metadata to the cells such that the cells will be hidden by default, and can be uncovered by the user.  The button will be introduced above the solution.
