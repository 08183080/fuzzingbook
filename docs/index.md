# Generating Software Tests
## Breaking Software for Fun and Profit

Welcome to "Generating Software Tests"!  This book teaches how to automate _software testing_, specifically by showing how to _generate tests automatically_.  Such generated tests can be extended into ordinary tests, by adding code that checks for correct behavior; or be used for "fuzzing", that is, finding inputs that cause a program to crash, hang, or otherwise malfunction.

This work is designed as a _textbook_ for a course in software testing; as _supplementary material_ in a software testing or software engineering course; and as a _resource for software developers_.  You can use each chapter in three ways:

* You can __[read it in your browser](html/Main.html)__.  Go to the [table of contents](html/Main.html), or start right away with the [preface](html/Preface.html) or [introduction to fuzzing](html/Basic_Fuzzing.html).

* You can __interact with it as a Jupyter Notebook__ (beta).  This allows you change and extend with the code, experimenting live in your browser.  Just click on "Open as notebook" at the top of each chapter.  Try it on the [introduction to fuzzing](html/Basic_Fuzzing.html).

* You can __view it as slides___ (beta).  This allows for presenting the material in lectures.  Just click on "View slides" at the top of each chapter. Try it on the [introduction to fuzzing](html/Basic_Fuzzing.html).

This book is _work in progress,_ with new chapters coming out every week.

## About the Authors

This book is written by Andreas Zeller, Rahul Gopinath, Marcel BÃ¶hme, Gordon Fraser, and Christian Holler.  All of us are long-standing experts in software testing and test generation; and we have written or contributed to some of the most impactful test generators on the planet.  As an example, if you are reading this in a Firefox, Chrome, or Edge Web browser, you can do so safely partly because of us, as _the very techniques listed in this book have found more than 2,600 bugs in their JavaScript interpreters so far._  We are happy to share our expertise and making it accessible to the public.


## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does it take so long to start an interactive notebook?

We use the [binder](https://mybinder.org) service, which runs notebooks on their own servers.  Starting Jupyter through binder normally takes about 30 seconds. If, however, you are the first to invoke binder after a book update, binder recreates its environment, which can take a few minutes.  Note, though, that binder is officially in beta and we do not have control over binder.


### I have a comment or a suggestion.  What do I do?

Report an issue on the [development page](https://github.com/uds-se/fuzzingbook/issues).


### I have reported an issue two weeks ago.  When will it be addressed?

We prioritize issues as follows:

1. Bugs in code published on fuzzingbook.org
2. Bugs in text published on fuzzingbook.org
3. Writing missing chapters
4. Issues in yet unpublished code or text
5. Issues related to development or construction
6. Things marked as "beta"
7. Everything else


### How can I solve problems myself?

We're glad you ask that.  The [development page](https://github.com/uds-se/fuzzingbook/) has all sources and some supplementary material.  Pull requests that fix issues are very welcome.


### How can I contribute?

Again, we're glad you're here!  See our [Guide for Authors](https://github.com/uds-se/fuzzingbook/notebooks/Guide_For_Authors.ipynb) for instructions on coding and writing.


### Do you provide PDFs of your material?

At this point, we do not provide support for PDF versions.  We are working on producing PDF and paper versions once the book is complete.
