# Generating Software Tests
## Fuzzing and Breaking Software for Fun and Profit

Welcome to "Generating Software Tests"!  This book addresses this problem by automated software testing, specifically by showing how to _generate tests automatically_.  Such generated tests can be extended into ordinary tests, by adding code that checks for correct behavior; or be used for "fuzzing", that is, finding inputs that cause a program to crash, hang, or otherwise malfunction.  The aim is to exercise a maximum of functionality with a minimum of effort.

The book is designed as a textbook for a course in software testing; or as supplementary material in a software testing or software engineering course; and as a resource for software developers.  You can use each chapter in three ways:

* You can __[read it in your browser](html/Main.html)__.  Go to the [table of contents](html/Main.html), or start right away with the [preface](html/Preface.html) or [introduction to fuzzing](html/Basic_Fuzzing.html).

* You can __interact with it as a Jupyter Notebook__ (beta).  This allows you change and extend with the code, experimenting live in your browser.  Just click on the "Open as notebook" at the top of each chapter.

* You can __view it as slides___ (beta).  This allows for presenting the material in lectures.

This book is work in progress, with new chapters coming out every week.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I have a comment or a suggestion.  What do I do?

Report an issue on the [development page](https://github.com/uds-se/fuzzingbook/issues).

### I have reported an issue two weeks ago.  When will it be addressed?

We prioritize issues as follows:

1. Bugs in code published on fuzzingbook.org
2. Bugs in text published on fuzzingbook.org
3. Writing missing chapters
4. Issues in yet unpublished code or text
5. Issues related to development or construction
6. Things marked as "beta"
7. Everything else

### How can I solve problems myself?

We're glad you ask that.  The [development page](https://github.com/uds-se/fuzzingbook/) has all sources and some supplementary material.  Pull requests that fix issues are very welcome.


### How can I contribute?

Again, we're glad you're here!  See our [Guide for Authors](https://github.com/uds-se/fuzzingbook/notebooks/Guide_For_Authors.ipynb) for instructions on coding and writing.


### Do you provide PDFs of your material?

At this point, we do not provide support for PDF versions.  We are working on producing PDF and paper versions once the book is complete.
