abstract="The many faces of programming and systems development demand an immense amount of mechanical routine work. The present paper tries to explain some areas where automation of many tasks may be of great help. One special area, where progress seems to lag behind unduly, can be found in debugging, testing, and diagnosing systems. Here we attempted the generation of programs automatically from a definition of a problem and the characteristics of programs for its solution by a software system, which has been specially designed for this purpose. It has been indicated how the ideas underlying this project may be applied successfully to other areas.",
