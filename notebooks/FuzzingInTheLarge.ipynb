The code in the `main` function simply reads a file provided on the command line and puts its contents into a buffer that is passed to `validateAndPerformAction`. That function pulls out two bytes of the buffer (`action` and `count`) and considers the rest `data`. Depending on the value of `action`, it then calls either `printFirst` or `printLast`, which prints either the first or the last `count` bytes of `data`. Sounds pointless, and yes, it is. The whole idea of this program is that the security check (that `count` is not larger than the length of `data`) is missing in `validateAndPerformAction` but that the illegal access happens later in either of the two print functions. Hence, we would expect this program to generate at least two (slightly) different crash signatures. Let's try it out with very simple fuzzing based on the last Python script:"

And indeed, if you visit [FuzzManager](http://127.0.0.1:8000/crashmanager/crashes/), you will notice a variety of crashes that have accumulated. Pick the first crash and create a bucket for it, like you did the last time. After saving, you will notice that not all of your crashes went into the bucket. The reason is that our program created several different stacks that are somewhat similar but not exactly identical. This is a common problem when fuzzing real world applications. Fortunately, there is an easy way to deal with this. While on the bucket page, hit the *Optimize* button for the bucket. FuzzManager will then automatically propose you to change your signature. Accept the change by hitting *Edit with Changes* and then *Save*. Repeat these steps until all crashes are part of the bucket. After 3 to 4 iterations, your signature will likely look like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "The *Optimize* function is designed to automate this process as much as possible: It attempts to broaden the signature by fitting it to untriaged crashes and then checks if the modified signature would touch other existing buckets. This works with the assumption that other buckets are indeed other bugs, i.e. if you had created two buckets from your crashes first, optimizing wouldn't work anymore. Also, if the existing bucket data is sparse and you have a lot of untriaged crashes, the algorithm could propose changes that include crashes of different bugs in the same bucket. There is no way to fully automatically detect and prevent this, hence the process is semi-automated and requires you to review all proposed changes."
