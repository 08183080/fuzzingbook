The code in the `main` function simply reads a file provided on the command line and puts its contents into a buffer that is passed to `validateAndPerformAction()`. That function pulls out two bytes of the buffer (`action` and `count`) and considers the rest `data`. Depending on the value of `action`, it then calls either `printFirst()` or `printLast()`, which prints either the first or the last `count` bytes of `data`. Sounds pointless, and yes, it is. The whole idea of this program is that the security check (that `count` is not larger than the length of `data`) is missing in `validateAndPerformAction()` but that the illegal access happens later in either of the two print functions. Hence, we would expect this program to generate at least two (slightly) different crash signatures."

This works with the assumption that other buckets are indeed other bugs, i.e. if you had created two buckets from your crashes first, optimizing wouldn't work anymore. Also, if the existing bucket data is sparse and you have a lot of untriaged crashes, the algorithm could propose changes that include crashes of different bugs in the same bucket. There is no way to fully automatically detect and prevent this, hence the process is semi-automated and requires you to review all proposed changes."
