    "This program looks way more elaborate compared to the last one, but don't worry, it isn't really doing a whole lot. The code in the `main` function simply reads a file provided on the command line and puts its contents into a buffer that is passed to `validateAndPerformAction`. That function pulls out two bytes of the buffer (`action` and `count`) and considers the rest `data`. Depending on the value of `action`, it then calls either `printFirst` or `printLast`, which prints either the first or the last `count` bytes of `data`. Sounds pointless, and yes, it is. The whole idea of this program is that the security check (that `count` is not larger than the length of `data`) is missing in `validateAndPerformAction` but that the illegal access happens later in either of the two print functions. Hence, we would expect this program to generate at least two (slightly) different crash signatures. Let's try it out with very simple fuzzing based on the last Python script:"
