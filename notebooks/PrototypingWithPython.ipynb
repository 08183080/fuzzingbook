    "Dynamic analysis is the ability to track what is happening during program execution.  The Python `settrace()` mechanism allows you to track all code lines, all variables, all values, as the program executes – and all this in a handful of lines of code.  Our `Coverage` class from [the chapter on coverage](Coverage.ipynb) shows how to capture a trace of all lines executed in five lines of code; such a trace easily converts into sets of lines or branches executed.  With two more lines, you can easily track all functions, arguments, variable values, too – see for instance our [chapter on dynamic invariants](DynamicInvariants).  And you can even access the source code of individual functions (and print it out, too!)  All this takes 10, maybe 20 minutes to implement."
