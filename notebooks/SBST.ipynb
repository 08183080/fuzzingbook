    "# Search-based Fuzzing\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we are interested not only in fuzzing diverse program inputs, but in deriving specific test inputs that achieve some objective, such as reaching specific statements in a program, or achieving code coverage. When we have an idea what we are looking for, then we can *search* it. Search algorithms are at the core of computer science, but classic search algorithms like breadth or depth first search potentially require us to look at all possible inputs, which is not realistically possible with program inputs. However, domain-knowledge can be used to overcome this problem. If we know or can estimate which of several program inputs is closer to the one we are looking for, then this information can guide us to reach the target quicker -- this information is known as a *heuristic*. The way heuristics are applied systematically is captured in *meta-heuristic* search algorithms. The \"meta\" denotes that these algorithm are generic and can be instantiated differently to different problems. Meta-heuristics often take inspiration from processes observed in nature. For example, there are algorithms mimicking evolutionary processes, swarm intelligence, or chemical reactions. In general they are so much more efficient than exhaustive search approaches such that they can be applied to vast search spaces --- search spaces as vast and vaster as the domain of program inputs are no problem for them."

The metaphor captures aptly what is happening: The algorithm tries to climb a hill in the search space defined by our representation. So what is the hill we are climbing? This is the *search landscape*. All meta-heuristics are based on the use of a heuristic function that estimates how good a given candidate solution is; this \"goodness\" is typically called the *fitness* of an individual, and the heuristic that estimates the fitness is the *fitness function*. The fitness function is a function that maps any candidate solution to a numerical value, the fitness value. If you plot each point in the search space with its fitness value as the height, you get a landscape with the optimal solution represented as the highest peak.\n",

    "\n",
    "The fitness function depends on the objective one would like to achieve with generating the test data. Very often, automated test data generation will be guided by coverage criteria, and the objective of one run of a search algorithm will be to cover one particular coverage item. Let's assume that we are interested in covering the true branch of the if-condition in the `testMe` function. How close is a given input tuple for this function from reaching the target branch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider what our hillclimber would need from the fitness function. It would typically start with a random test input, i.e., random values for `x` and `y`. For any pair of random integer numbers, the chances of them satisfying the condition `x == 2 * (y + 1)` are rather slim. Suppose the random values are `(274, 153)`. The right hand side of the equation, `2 * (y + 1)`, evaluates to 308, so the condition is clearly false. Where should the hillclimber go to now? The neighborhood of `(274, 153)` consists of the tuples `(273, 153)`, `(275, 153)`, `(274, 152)`, `(274, 154)`, `(273, 152)`, `(275, 154)`, `(273, 154)`, and `(275, 152)`; that is, all immediate numerical neighbors. Increasing `y` by one increases the value of the right hand side of the equation to `310`. Thus, the value on the left hand side of the equation thus differs *even more* to the value on the right hand side of the equation than it did before the increase! So, increasing `y` does not seem like a good idea. On the other hand, increasing `x` by one improves things: The left hand side and the right hand side of the equation become more similar; they are \"less unequal\". Thus, out of the eight possible neighbors of `(274, 153)`, the neighbor that increases `x` and decreases `y` seems best intuitively --- the outcome of the condition is still false, but it is \"less so\" than for the original value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to capture this intuition of what is \"more\" or \"less\" true or false numerically for the hillclimber, such that it can automatically choose the best neighbor. Fortunately, this is quite easy: In the example we have an equality check, and intuitively the further the left hand side and the right hand side of the comparison are apart, the \"more\" false the equation is. Thus, we can quantify \"how false\" the comparison is by calculating the difference between `x` and `2 * (y + 1)`. For input `(274, 153)` this distance is `|274 - 308| = 34`. For the best neighbor `(275, 152)` this distance is `|275 - 306| = 31`. One important thing to note here is that, in this example, \"better\" means *lower* distance values. Thus, to use the branch distance as fitness function to guide the search we need to aim to minimize this distance, rather than maximizing it --- rather than climbing hills, we need to descend cavities. Fortunately, this is simple enough --- all we have to do to switch a hillclimber from maximizing to minimizing fitness values is to change the direction of the relational comparison `>` to `<`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For any test input `(x, y)` we can calculate this distance as `abs(x - 2 * (y + 1))`. Thus, for each value in the search space of integer tuples, this distance value defines the elevation in our search landscape. "

Even though in our example the condition is an equation using the input values of the function directly, this may not be the case in general; it might as well be derived values. Thus, the values we need to calculate our distance metric need to be observed directly at the conditional statement.

Because the same branch can be executed several times for any test input in general (although not in this specific case), we need to decide what to do when given several values. For any given execution, the value that is of most interest is the one *closest* to making the branch true. Thus, we store the new distance value only if it is smaller than any executions observed so far. Therefore, `distance` is initialised with the largest possible value (`sys.maxint`), such that *any* execution (except the very worst case) will lead to a smaller value than the one assigned when the branching condition is not executed at all.

The latter is a common trick in test generation, as in *most* cases solutions tend to consist of small values, and using small values to start the search makes the search quicker in many cases. However, what if the solution we need is at a completely different place in our search space? Our bias towards smaller solutions would mean that the hillclimber would take very long to find the solution, and given a fixed search budget it would thus be less likely to actually find a solution. To see what effects this would have, simply try replacing the `1000` with `sys.maxint` in the example and run the hillclimber again: You will note that in most cases the search now will take extremely long until a solution is found --- much longer than we are prepared to wait for such a simple example function!

If `B` is an expression with side-effects, then by calculating the branch distance of `B` even though short-circuit evaluation would avoid its execution, we would potentially be changing the program behavior (by invoking the side-effect that would in normal behavior not be executed), and that is not acceptable.\n",

    "The `BranchDistanceTransformer` parses a target Python program using the built-in parser `ast.parse`, which returns the AST. Python provides API to traverse and modify this AST. To replace the comparison with a function call we use an `ast.NodeTransformer`, which uses the visitor pattern where there is one `visit_*` function for each type of node in the AST. As we are interested in replacing comparisons, we override `visit_Compare`, where instead of the original comparison node we return a new node of type `ast.Func`, which is a function call node. The first parameter of this node is the name of the function `BranchDistance`), and the arguments are the four arguments that our `BranchDistance` function expects: Number of branch (for which we keep a count in `branchNum`), the operator (for which we simply use the class name), the left-hand side, and the right-hand side. Note that Python allows comparisons of multiple expressions (e.g. `1 < x < 10`); to keep the code simple we only deal with individual comparisons here, but it would be straight forward to extend the code by treating each comparison with an individual call to `BranchPredicate`.\n"

    "As an example, suppose our test target is the part of `cgi_decode` that decodes valid hexadecimal codes. This means that we want to make branch predicate 1 true, 2 false, 3 true, and 4 true. To represent such a path, we can simply sum up the branch distances for exactly these branches. However, there is a potential issue with simply summing up branch distances: If the distance for one branch depends on a comparison of very large values and the distance calculation for another branch depends on small values, then an improvement of the large values would very likely lead to a better fitness improvement, and thus bias the search. To avoid this, we need to *normalize* branch distances before adding them up."

The important thing about the function is that for any two numbers `x` and `y` the ordering needs to be preserved by the normalisation. That is, if `x<y` then it must also hold that `normalize(x) < normalize(y)`. There are many different functions that could achieve this result; a simple one is `normalize(x) = x/(x+k)`: It is computationally cheap, and will normalise any positive value in the range `[0,1]` (to change this to `[0,b]` one would just need to multiply by `b`). If we use this normalisation function, we know our `K` exactly: it is `1.0`. The function assumes that the value to be normalised is positive. The value of the factor `k` defines the steepness of the curve. For example, for `k=1` (which is a good default value) the curve is very steep, with values quickly approaching, but never reaching, `1`."

    "The hillclimber explores the local neighbourhood of an individual in each step of the search, and if the neighbourhood is too large, then this takes too long. An alternative strategy is to not restrict the search to the local neighbourhood, but to search the search space *globally*. That is, the search algorithm is allowed to make larger steps around the search space. A simple modification of the hillclimber converts it from a local to a global search algorithm: Instead of looking at all the immediate neighbours, the individual is *mutated* in a way that allows larger modifications. Then, the resulting offspring individual is compared to its parent, and the better of the two is the new point in the search space, and used for the next iteration of mutation.
